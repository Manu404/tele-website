            Is a project initiated in 2019 by guitarist Emmanuel Istace. After years of interest in multiple genre and others' projects, this one is the convergence of his musical and software/electronic engeneering skills.<br />
            The goal ? Perform "In C", alone, and provide a new experience of the piece to the audience every time. With a strong emphasis on "true" live performance, no automation or prerecorded material or synth/virtual instruments.<br />
            The ensemble is composed of a set of 8 independent loopers, the whole controlled by Emmanuel Istace, and his guitar as a sound brush.<br />
            For this performance, a lot of both musical and technical challenge had to be overcome, leading to months of preparation to perform this piece alone and provide a memorable experience for the audience.
            An emphasis had been made on the live performance, using a couple led matrix crates/speaker for each looper, as if they were performers on stage.
            Those crates/speaker can be organized on stage in row regarding their L/R panning or placed in a room where audience can navigate between each one, creating a different, yet interesting and immersive experience of the piece.

            "In C" is a piece composed by Terry Riley in 1964 for an undefined number of performers. It is a series of 53 short melodic fragment and is usually considered as one the first minimalist piece written.
            During the performance, each musician have the control over continuing to play the current motif, moving to the next one or stop playing and wait to join back.
            That can be considered as kind of "composed improvisation", where each performers would rely on repetitive "licks".
            Due to the qualities of each fragment, music emerge from the performers choices, phasing play a major role in creating new interesting sound, melodies and textures.
            The piece has an average duration of 45 to 90 minutes, and is performed by "The Electric Looper Ensemble" usually in 30 to 45 minutes, each performance being unique.
            This performance consider each looper as an individual performer, so this could be considered an octet performance.

            It would be tempting to use different instruments, and it was envision at the begening, to switch between an electric bass, fender stratocaster guitar, gibson es-125 guitar, nylon classical guitar and a mandoline.
            But it's even more challenging and satisfying for the performer and the audience to ear that variety of colors and texture comming from a single instrument. A great benefit is taken from the basic volume and tone controls on the guitar itself.
                <br />As Andres Segovia said: "the guitar is an orchestra", it's a major part of the interest a guitarist sustain toward his instrument over his musical journey. To discover, learn and control those different voices on the instrument, sometimes relying on "unorthodox" techniques. The guitar is like giving focus on a section of the orchestra, and that focus can be achieved by the variety of tone it can produce.
                <br />"The guitar is the only stringed instrument really polyphonic", said maestro Segovia too, meaning multiple notes can be played at the same time, while most of the other stringed instrument have to rely on arpeggios or limited polyphony for the average musician. But yet, the guitar is not like a piano, each string have her own character, her own soul and intentions, and the same pitch can be found on mulitple places through different strings, yet, with singular remarkable differences between each. Those are then filtered by the performer technique who decide how those singular position will sound regarding their instrinsic characteristics.
                <br />Most think those qualities are lost outside of the truely acoustic nylon classical guitar, but same techniques and considerations leading to beautifull expressivness apply to the electric guitar.

                Live looping is a technique that consist or recording live a sound and playing it back, one or multiple times. <br />
                The main idea of live looping is to use no automation or pre-recorded materials during the performance, everything you ear, was played, recorded and mixed during the live performance by the artist.
                <br />
                For the need of this performance, Mobius was first used, hosted in Reaper. But the encouter of Emmanuel Reveneau along way lead the artist to discover Usine
                and design a fully custom live environement.

            Each matrix is build around a design adapted by Li√®ge Hackerspace from (TODO) project. It consist of a led within each bottle in crates, then controlled by an electronic device that allows to push informations about what to display. For this case, each matrix/speaker are in fact independant. They all act as a receiver from their associated looper and act as autonomous unit. To communicate, they are all in network to share audio signal. Each crate allow to have a visual feedback of each loop through sound visualization algorithms.
